DESCRIPTION
This module implements a driver for the Motorola/Freescale Enhanced
Three Speed Ethernet Controller (ETSEC) network interface. The ETSEC
supports 10, 100 and 1000Mbps operation over copper and fiber media.

The ETSEC is unusual in that it uses three different interrupt vectors:
one for RX events, one for TX events and one for error events. The
intention is to shave some cycles from the interrupt service path
by jumping directly to the proper event handler routine instead of
the driver having to determine the nature of pending events itself.

Note that while this driver is VxBus-compliant, it does not use
vxbDmaBufLib. The reason for this is that vxbDmaBufLib is technically
only required for drivers for DMA-based devices that must be portable
among multiple architectures (e.g. PCI or VMEbus adapters). The ETSEC
is not a standalone device: it only exists as an integrated component
of certain MPC85xx and MPC83xx PowerPC CPUs. It is always big-endian,
it is always cache-coherent (since we always enable the ETSEC's snooping
features), and it never needs bounce buffering or address translation.
Given this, we may as well forgo the use of vxbDmaBufLib entirely,
since using it will do nothing except add a bit of extra overhead to
the packet processing paths.

The ETSEC supports several advanced features not present in the original
TSEC. This includes TCP/IP checksum offload support, hardware VLAN tag
insertion and stripping, hardware packet parsing and filing, and transmit
packet prioritization. The receive filter logic also supports a wider
multicast hash filter (512 bits vs 256 in the original TSEC) and a 16
entry CAM filter. This driver includes support for the checksum features
and the filer, and uses the CAM filter and expanded hash table to provided
improved multicast filtering, but does not support the VLAN tag
insertion/stripping feature or the transmit prioritization.

The VLAN tagging/stripping is not supported because of an incompatibility
between the hardware and our VLAN support code. When VLAN insertion is
enabled for transmit, the hardware always inserts a VLAN tag: if no frame
control block with a valid VLAN control field is present, it uses the value
from the DFVLAN register. This is not the behavior we expect: the decision
whether or not to insert a tag at all should be done on a per-frame basis,
not globally. The ETSEC's design makes it impossible to send untagged
frames as long as the VLINS bit in the transmit control register is set,
which is not what we want. (I am mystified as to why Freescale felt the
need to impliment it this way.)

The transmit packet prioritization is not supported, because it requires
the use of multiple transmit DMA queues. Currently, there is no API
available in the MUX or the TCP/IP stack to enable us to support multiple
TX queues.

For the RX frame parser and filer, the ETSEC supports up to 8 physical
DMA queues, and up to 64 virtual queues. Currently, we support only 8
queues, with the queue ID corresponding to one of the physical DMA rings.
When the filer is enabled, special device-specific ioctls can be used to
program the filer to distribute frames among the queues depending on
the various filtering properties supported by the hardware. A few simple
cases are also provided as examples. Currently, the MUX/END API does not
support multiple input queues, so the driver uses the filer and RX queues
to prioritize the order in which the frames are sent to the stack. The
driver considers queue 0 to have the highest priority and queue 7 the
lowest. When frames arrive, those directed to queue 0 will be processed
first, followed by queue 1, and queue 2, and so on. If the filer is
programmed to reject certain frames, they won't be seen at all.

Since using the filer requires configuring all 8 RX DMA queues, which
consumes a large amount of memory, the filer support is off by default.
It can be enabled using the "filerEnable" configuration parameter, as
shown below.

SMP CONSIDERATIONS
While the ETSEC has three interrupt vectors, it has only one interrupt
status register and one interrupt mask register. Each interrupt service
routine can only mask off specific interrupt events without touching
the others (i.e. the RX ISR can only mask RX events). Doing this requires
clearing bits in the mask register using a read-modify-write operation,
which is not atomic. A similar read-modify-write operation is used in
the task level interrupt handler code to un-mask interrupts as well.
For proper SMP synchronization, these operations must be guarded with
a spinlock.

AMP CONSIDERATIONS
The MPC8641D dual core processor contains 4 ETSEC devices, and can be
run in either SMP or AMP mode. In AMP mode, it may be desireable to
allocate the on-board ETSEC interface among the cores, i.e. assigning
ETSEC0 and ETSEC1 to core0, and ETSEC2 and ETSEC3 to core1. There are two
complications involved in doing this.

The first is that while there are four complete ETSEC controllers, there
is only one functional MDIO port (namely the one associated with ETSEC0).
Reading or writing a PHY register through the MDIO registers is not an
atomic operation, which means simultaneous accesses by both cores will
overlap and likely fail. To guard against this, the tsecMdio driver should
be used in conjuction with the ETSEC driver. This driver provides a
simple inter-core synchronization mechanism which allows both cores to
share access to the MDIO port without contention.

The second complication involves address translation. To use VxWorks in
AMP mode on the 8641D, low memory offset mode must be enabled. In this
mode, the second core applies a bias of 256MB to memory addresses. The
Freescale 8641D eval board is configured with 512MB of RAM: using low
memory offset mode effectively splits the memory into 256MB banks, with
core0 using the first bank and core1 using the second. Using low memory
offset mode allows the second core to think that the second bank of RAM
starting at address 0x10000000 actually starts at address 0x0. This allows
the same VxWorks image linked for core0 to run on core1 unmodified.

This bias only applies to the CPU core, however: it does not apply to
the ETSEC controllers, which still need to be provided with the absolute
physical addresses of descriptors and packet buffers in order to perform
DMA correctly. This means that when running on the second core, the
ETSEC driver must perform a virtual to physical address translation on
all DMA addresses. A <physMask> configuration property is provided to
specify the virtual to physical bias offset. For ETSEC instances allocated
to core0, this property can be left undefined, or explicitly set to 0.
For ETSEC instances allocated to core1, <physMask> should be set to
0x10000000.

Assigning an ETSEC instance to a particular core is done by setting the
<coreNum> configuration property. If <coreNum> is not defined, or
explicitly set to 0 for a particular ETSEC instance, then that instance
will be assigned to core0. If <coreNum> is set to 1, it will be assigned
to core1 instead. Any ETSEC can be assigned to any core (the BSP defaults
to assigning ETSEC0 and ETSEC1 to the first core and ETSEC2 and ETSEC3 to
the second).

BOARD LAYOUT
The ETSEC is directly integrated into the CPU. All configurations are
jumperless.

EXTERNAL INTERFACE
The driver provides a vxBus external interface. The only exported
routine is the etsecRegister() function, which registers the driver
with VxBus. Since the ETSEC is a processor local bus device, each device
instance must be specified in the hwconf.c file in a BSP. The hwconf entry
The hwconf entry must specify the following parameters:
parameters:
 
\is
 
\i <regBase>
Specifies the base address where the controller's CSR registers are mapped
into the host's address space. All register offsets are computed relative
to this address.
 
\i <intr0>
Specifies the interrupt vector for the ETSEC's TX interrupts.
 
\i <intrLevel0>
Specifies the interrupt level for the ETSEC's TX interrupts.

\i <intr1>
Specifies the interrupt vector for the ETSEC's RX interrupts.
 
\i <intrLevel1>
Specifies the interrupt level for the ETSEC's RX interrupts.

\i <intr2>
Specifies the interrupt vector for the ETSEC's error interrupts.
 
\i <intrLevel2>
Specifies the interrupt level for the ETSEC's error interrupts.

\i <tbiAddr>
Specifies the address to use for the internal TBI management interface.
This value will be programmed into the TBIPA register, and controls
the address at which the TBI management registers will be visible when
accessing the MII management port. When the ETSEC is not operating in
TBI mode, this value should be set so that it does not conflict with
the address of a copper PHY, or else the management registers of the
copper PHY will be obscured.

\i <phyAddr>
Specifies the address of the PHY allocated to this ETSEC instance. On
most boards, all PHYs share the same management port, so we must specify
explicitly which PHY on the management bus maps to which ETSEC.

\i <miiIfName>
Specifies the name of the VxBus device driver that manages this ETSEC's
MDIO management port. In the UP and SMP cases, motetsec0 is designated
as the manager of the MDIO port. For AMP, this must be set to the
"tsecMdio" driver: this driver has special support for synchronizing
access to ETSEC0's MDIO registers between cores.

\i <miiIfUnit>
The unit number that goes with <miiIfName>. Together, these describe
a specific VxBus instance (i.e. motesec0, or tsecMdio0).

\i <coreNum>
Specifies the core to which to allocate this particular ETSEC in an AMP
configuration. If this property is omitted or explicitly set to 0, then the
ETSEC instance will be bound to core0. If set to 1, it will be bound to
core1. Any ETSEC may be mapped to any core. In UP and SMP mode, this
property should not be used.

\i <physMask>
Specifies the memory offset to apply when translating virtual addresses
to physical addresses on ETSECs that are bound to the second core in an
AMP configuration. For ETSECs bound to core0, this property should be
ommitted or set to 0. For ETSECs bound to core1, it should be set to
0x10000000. This property should only be used when <coreNum> is set to 1.

\i <l2disable>
Specifies whether L2 cache extraction should be disabled. According to
Freescale, the ETSEC ports on the MPC8641D do not support this feature,
in spite of the fact that the manual says it does. Unfortunately
there's no way to autoprobe this, so we provide a way to disable this
capability on a per-interface basis. If this property is set to 0 or
omitted, L2 cache extraction for received packets is enabled. If set
to any non-zero value, L2 cache extraction is disabled.
\ie

An example hwconf entry is shown below:

\cs
const struct hcfResource tsecVxbEnd0Resources[] = {
    { "regBase",        HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)(CCSBAR + 0x24000) } },
    { "intr0",          HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1TX_INT_VEC } },
    { "intr0Level",     HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1TX_INT_VEC } },
    { "intr1",          HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1RX_INT_VEC } },
    { "intr1Level",     HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1RX_INT_VEC } },
    { "intr2",          HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1ERR_INT_VEC } },
    { "intr2Level",     HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)EPIC_TSEC1ERR_INT_VEC } },
    { "phyAddr",        HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)0 } },
#ifdef INCLUDE_AMP
    { "miiIfName",      HCF_RES_STRING, { (void *)"tsecMdio" } },
    { "miiIfUnit",      HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)0 } },
    { "coreNum",        HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)0 } }
#else
    { "miiIfName",      HCF_RES_STRING, { (void *)"motetsec" } },
    { "miiIfUnit",      HCF_RES_INT,    { (void *)0 } }
#endif
};
#define tsecVxbEnd0Num NELEMENTS(tsecVxbEnd0Resources)
\ce

The ETSEC controller also supports jumbo frames. This driver has 
jumbo frame support, which is disabled by default in order to conserve 
memory (jumbo frames require the use of an buffer pool with larger clusters).
Jumbo frames can be enabled on a per-interface basis using a parameter
override entry in the hwconf.c file in the BSP. For example, to enable
jumbo frame support for interface motetsec0, the following entry should be
added to the VXB_INST_PARAM_OVERRIDE table:

    { "motetsec", 0, "jumboEnable", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)1} }

The ETSEC controller also supports interrupt coalescing. This driver
has coalescing support, which is disabled by default so that the
'out of the box' configuration has the smallest interrupt latency.
Coalescing can be anabled on a per-interface basis using parameter
overrides in the hwconf.c file, in the same way as jumbo frame
support. In addition to turning the coalescing support on and
off, the timeout and packet count values can be set:

    { "motetsec", 0, "coalesceEnable", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)1} }
    { "motetsec", 0, "coalesceRxTicks", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)10} }
    { "motetsec", 0, "coalesceRxPkts", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)8} }
    { "motetsec", 0, "coalesceTxTicks", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)100} }
    { "motetsec", 0, "coalesceTxPkts", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)16} }

If only the <coalesceEnable> property is set, the driver will use
default timeout and packet count values as shown above. Specifying
alternate values via the BSP will override the defaults.

To enable support for the filer and multiple RX queues, the <filerEnable>
property should also be set, as illustrated below:

    { "motetsec", 0, "filerEnable", VXB_PARAM_INT32, {(void *)1} }

Note that the filer support can not be enabled or disabled on the fly
at runtime.

* This function loads an example set of rules into the ETSEC's RX frame

* as a development aid for those wishing to construct their own rulesets.
*
* The five rules are designed to process incoming traffic as follows:
*
* - All packets with a valid TCP header are put into DMA queue 0
* - All packets with a value UDP header are put into DMA queue 1
* - All IP packets with a protocol time of IPPROTO_ICMP are put
*   into DMA queue 2
* - All ethernet ARP frames are put into DMA queue 3
* - All other frames are diverted to DMA queue 7
*
* Note that when the filer is enabled, all 8 DMA queues are enabled, but
* only one will will be used if the filer is left unprogrammed, so in
* addition to acting as a coding/API usage sample, this routine also allows
* us to exercise and validate the multi-queue RX handling code in the driver.
*
* The TCP and UDP packet selection is done using the 'frame properties'
* filtering rule. We set the filter_mask register so that on the 'TCP
* header parsed' and 'UDP header parsed' bits in the frame properties
* word are considered. (The mask is restored afterwards so as not to
* affect subsequent rules.)
*
* Filtering of ICMP traffic is performed using a 'level 4 protocol
* identifier' rule that matches all packets with a protocol ID of
* IPPROTO_ICMP. Note that matching of TCP and UDP traffic can also be
* done using this type of rule (to test for IPPROTO_TCP or IPPROTO_UDP),
* but we filter TCP and UDP using the 'frame properties' rule instead
* to give an example of both rule types.
*
* Filtering of ARP frames is done using an 'ethertype' filtering rule,
* which matches on frames containing ETHERTYPE_ARP.
*
* The final rule is an 'always match' rule that dumps all traffic that
* doesn't match any of the previous rules into  DMA queue 7.

     * always true, so we have to handle two cases: the case where
     * we have leading space, and the case where we don't. When we
     * do have space, we simply insert the FCB at the head of the
     * first buffer and then fall through the code below to traverse
     * the remaining mBlks in the chain. In the case where we don't
     * have sufficient space, we add an extra fragment to the DMA,
     * using a spare buffer of our own. DMAing such a small buffer
     * is not a very efficient use of bandwidth, but it is legal
     * according to the hardware spec, and it's really the only
     * choice we have (aside from recopying the packet). Fortunately,
     * the latter case does not occur very frequently in normal usage.
