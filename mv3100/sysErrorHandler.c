DESCRIPTION

INTRODUCTION:

This module is included via #define of INCLUDE_ERROR_HANDLING.

This module implements generic error handling support.  Software which
detects an error, either through interrupts or via soft scan of
hardware can make use of this module to "dispose" of the error.
Disposition can consist of displaying an immediate indication of the
error and/or saving the information about the error in a log which can
be queried later.  An optional user-written function can also be
called upon occurrence of a particular error.  This module does not
itself detect errors but instead offers supporting functions which
allow for handling of errors, which are detected elsewhere in the
system, in a uniform way.

CONNECTING TO THE ERROR HANDLING MODULE:

Before making use of the error handling services software must
"connect" with the error handling module.  This is a two-step process
consisting first of (1) Domain Initialization and secondly of (2)
Error Registrations.  After these two steps are completed actual
logging of specific errors can be performed.

Before proceeding a distinction must be made between error
"registration" and error "logging".

Error "registration" is done once for each possible error.  It is
through "registration" that the error handling module is presented
with a unique error ID which will be monitored by application software
as the system runs.  Note that "registering" and error does not mean
that the error has occurred, it just means that this particular error
is being monitored and could potentially be logged.

Error "logging" is what is done when application software detects an
error and informs the error handling module that the error has
actually occurred.  The error handling module then disposes of the
error according to rules which were established when the error was
registered.  Thus it can be seen that to successfully log an error,
that error must first have been registered.

1) DOMAIN INITIALIZATION:

The error handling module considers a "domain" to be a software
subsystem which deals with a major component of the system.  Examples
of domains would be "CPU", "Host Bridge", "PCI", "VME Bridge"
etc.  The user has some flexibility in defining these domains.  A
domain need not necessarily be confined to actual hardware on the board,
it could be a user application such as "Widget".   It is anticipated
that there will be at most a small handful of domains associated with
a specific system.  

A "domain" is identified by two things:

a)  An error domain ID.  Such an ID consists of a 32-bit identifier,
    of which only the top byte actually identifies the domain.
    For example the host bridge might have a domain ID of 0x02000000.
    (Here the high order byte "0x02" identifies this as the host
    bridge domain,  the CPU domain might have an ID of 0x01000000).
    The domain ID is important because every error which is eventually
    logged and has an error ID of the form 0x02xxxxxx will be assumed 
    to be associated with the host bridge domain because of "0x02" as 
    the high order byte.

       and

b)  An string e.g. "Disco 2" (which will be used in display of
    subsequently logged errors).  This string can be a maximum
    of 8 characters in length.

Each domain can contain three functions important to the error handling
module: 

1) An error scanning function - 'errorScan (errorId)':
     This function, when called with a specific error ID, will "scan"
     for the assertion of the error associated with this ID.  This
     is useful for errors which are not associated with interrupts and
     must be "polled" via soft read of a hardware register.

2) An error clearing function - 'errorClear (errorId)':
     This function, when called with a specific error ID, will "clear"
     an asserted error.  Again this could be used in association with
     non-interrupt generating errors to clear status bits which
     were set when the error was asserted.

3) An error formatting function - 'errorFormat (errorId)'
     This function is called by the error handling module to format
     an error message associated with a particular error.  This
     function would be called by the error handling module in
     preparation to display the message on the console.

A domain can have all three of these functions but it is not required 
to have any of them.

Each separate domain (e.g. "CPU", "PCI", "Widget") must separately
establish initialization with the error handling module.  

A single function call from application code into the error handling
module will initialize a specific domain.  An example of how to do
this for a VME bridge domain called "Tsi148" is presented below in
the following code fragment:

.CS
    /@ Forward references to this domain's helper functions @/

    char * tsi148ErrorFormat (ERROR_ID id);
    BOOL   tsi148ErrorScan   (ERROR_ID id);
    BOOL   tsi148ErrorClear  (ERROR_ID id);

    /@ Error module tells me about his functions in here @/

    ERROR_UTILS * myErrorUtils;

    /@
     * I, "Tsi148" domain, tell error module about 
     * my helper functions in here.
     @/

    ERROR_USR_FUNCS tsi148ErrorFuncs;

    ...

    /@ Initialize pointers to my format, scan, and clear functions @/

    tsi148ErrorFuncs.myErrorFormat = tsi148ErrorFormat;
    tsi148ErrorFuncs.myErrorScan = tsi148ErrorScan;
    tsi148ErrorFuncs.myErrorClear = tsi148ErrorClear;

    if (_func_errorHandlerInit == NULL)
	{
	logMsg ("Error Handling Suite not linked\n",0,0,0,0,0,0);
	return(FALSE);
	}

    /@ Here's the call which initializes the domain !!! @/

    myErrorUtils = (* _func_errorHandlerInit) (0x03000000,"Tsi148", 
					       &tsi148ErrorFuncs);

    /@ Now test to see if domain initialization actually worked @/

    if (myErrorUtils.errorLog == NULL)
	{

	/@
	 * myErrorUtils.errorLog == NULL is the error handling module's
	 * way of telling me the the domain initialization failed.
         @/

	printf ("Tsi148 error domain initialization FAILED\n")
	}
    else
	{

	/@
	 * Domain initialization succeeded:
	 * Now myErrorUtils.errorRegister points to the error handling
	 * module's error registration function and
	 * myErrorUtils.errorLog points to the error handling module's
	 * error logging function
         @/

	printf ("Tsi148 error domain initialization SUCCEEDED\n");

	}

	...

   /@ Here are my actual helper functions - more on this later @/

   char * tsi148ErrorFormat (ERROR_ID id)
       {
       ... /@ More said about this later @/
       }

   BOOL tsi148ErrorScan   (ERROR_ID id)
       {
       ...  /@ More said about this later @/
       }

   BOOL widgetErrorClear  (ERROR_ID id)
       {
       ... /@ More said about this later @/
       }


.CE

Notice the information that is exchanged during this domain
initialization.  The application (domain) code informs the error
handling module of its domain ID, domain ASCII string, error
formatting function, error scanning function and error clearing
function.  The error handling module in turn informs the application
(domain) code of its error registration function and error logging
function.

2) ERROR REGISTRATIONS:

After a domain has initialized as described above, it must "register"
each error that it is going to monitor and could potentially "log".
This is done by calling the "error registration" function, whose
pointer was given to the domain initialization code during in the
previous step.

The following code fragment (a continuation of the fragment
illustrating domain initialization) accomplishes this:

.CS
        /@
	 * Forward reference to error handler function 
         * and declaration of error handler function parameter
         @/

	void tsi148ErrorHandler (int param);
	int errorParam = 0x1234;

        /@
         * This tells how we wish to "dispose" of the error whenever
         * it is logged.
         @/

        ERROR_DISPOSITION disposition;

        ...

        disposition = ( ERROR_DISP_SAVE |
                        ERROR_DISP_IMMEDIATE_DISPLAY |
		        ERROR_DISP_FUNCTION_CALL ); 

	/@ Here is the call that actually registers an error @/

	if (* myErrorUtils.errorRegister)(0x03010201,
                                          disposition,
				          tsi148ErrorHandler,
	                                  errorParam);

        ...


   /@
    * This function will be executed when the 0x03010201 error
    * is actually "logged" because 'disposition' included
    * ERROR_DISP_FUNCTION_CALL and we did provide a nonNull
    * function pointer: tsi148ErrorHandler
    @/

   void tsi148ErrorHandler     (int param)
       {
       logMsg("tsi148 error handler called with argument %d\n",param);
       }

.CE

Note several things about the above example:

The function call which actually performs the registration is done
through a function pointer which was given to the domain code during
domain initialization (myErrorUtils.errorRegister).  

There are four parameters used in this function call: An error ID
(0x03010201), a "disposition", a pointer to an error handling
function, and an error handling function parameter.

The error code in this example is 0x03010201.  Notice that the high
order byte 0x03 matches the high order byte used to initialize the
"Tsi148" domain.  This is important because the error handling module
will refer to that domain's error formatting, error scanning and/or
error clearing function when it is asked to deal with this error.

The disposition in this example enables all of the active
possibilities: "save", "immediate display" and "function call".
"Save" (ERROR_DISP_SAVE) means that any future calls into the error
module to "log" an occurrence of this error will cause the information
about the error to be saved in an internal error log which can later
be displayed.  "Immediate display" (ERROR_DISP_IMMEDIATE_DISPLAY)
means that when an error is logged, an immediate display (to the
console) of this error occurrence will be performed by the error
module.  "Function call" (ERROR_DISP_FUNCTION_CALL) means that
when this particular error is "logged", the last two parameters in the 
registration call will be used to construct a function call with a 
specified parameter.  That function can be anything that the user 
desires.  

The third parameter (function pointer) can be NULL if no function
is to be called when the error is logged.  In that case, even if
ERROR_DISP_FUNCTION_CALL is part of the "disposition" no function
will be called.

There is one other possible "disposition".  If the registration
"disposition" is ERROR_DISP_IGNORE, then no action is taken by the
error handling module when the error is logged.

An error can be registered more than one time.  Each error is uniquely
identified by an error ID so if a call is made to register an error ID
which has been previously registered, the information saved from the
previous registration is overwritten.  This can be useful if
application code wants to change the disposition of an error at
run time.

An error can be registered any time after the system is up, even
after error logging has begun.

ERROR LOGGING:

Once the domain has been initialized, and a particular error has
been registered it is possible that the error will assert itself.
If the software is written so that it can detect the assertion of
the error, it can call the error handling module to "log" the
error.  The following code fragment continues the example:

   
.CS

   ERROR_MSG myErrorMsg;
   
   ...

   /@ Tsi148 code detects a "bus" error and wishes to log it @/
      
   myErrorMsg.id = 0x03010201	/@ ID of bus error, previously registered @/

   myErrorMsg.params[0] = <status reg value, read from HW = 0x00002000>
   myErrorMsg.params[1] = <access address, read from HW = 0xc000ffff>

   (* myErrorUtils.errorLog) (&myErrorMsg);

.CE

That's it.  Logging the error simply involves loading an ERROR_MSG
structure with the ID of the error to log (that ID must have
previously been registered).  Also up to six parameters are available
to provide additional information about the error.  In this example
two of those parameters are loaded with HW register values.  The
function called to actually log the error is pointed at by a function
pointer which we learned about during domain initialization.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN ERROR IS LOGGED?:

The error logging is initiated when the application code makes a call
to the error handling module's error logging function.  The application
code knows which function to call because the logging function pointer 
was passed to it during domain initialization.

The error handling module first attaches a "time tag", to the error
message.  This tag indicates the date and time that the error log
request was received.

The error handling module then checks to see if the error ID has been
previously registered.  If it has not then the logging request is
rejected and ERROR is returned to the logging requester.

Now that the error handling module knows that the error is registered,
it checks the disposition of the error which was set during the last
registration call for that particular error ID.  If the error
disposition is ERROR_DISP_IGNORE there is no more work to do and the
error handling module returns OK.

The error disposition is not "ignore" so the next disposition
possibility checked is ERROR_DISP_FUNCTION_CALL.  If this disposition
is set, and the error function pointer which was presented at
registration time is not NULL, the user function is called with the
parameter that was registered.  Note that execution is still in the
same thread as the error logging call so if the function which is
doing the error logging is an interrupt service routine it should be
careful to obey ISR rules (don't do any blocking calls).

Once the disposition of "function call" has been handled, the error
logging request is posted to a message queue which is being read by a
separate execution thread called the "error task".  The error logging
execution thread then returns OK to the caller.

The error task will read the message queue to obtain the error logging
request.  It will check the registration disposition to see if it
includes ERROR_DISP_IMMEDIATE_DISPLAY.  If it does, then an indication
that the error occurred is displayed at this time (more about how this
error display is formatted is presented later).

Once the "display immediately" disposition has been handled by the
error task, it checks to see if the disposition also includes
ERROR_DISP_SAVE.  If it does, then the information included in the
original error message (along with the time tag which was added) is
saved in a circular error logging table.  The size of this table is
governed by ERROR_LOG_TABLE_SIZE.  The entry is placed at the end of
the table.  If the table is full and there is no room for this entry
to be saved, the oldest saved entry is replaced by this one.  Thus the
table will contain only the latest errors logged.

The handling of the logging request is now complete.

FORMATTING ERROR MESSAGES FOR DISPLAY:

During the domain initialization, the application code presents to
the error handling module three function pointers.  One of these
is the error message formatting pointer.  Continuing our example,
here is how the formatting function might look for the "Tsi148"
domain:

.CS
    char * tsi148ErrorFormat (ERROR_ID id);
        {
	switch (id)
	    {
	    case 0x03010201:
		return ("Bus error: status = 0x%08x, addr = 0x%08x");
            case 0x03010202:
                ....
	    default: 
		return (NULL);
	    }
        }
.CE

Notice that the formatting string does NOT include actual parameters
for the formatting specifiers.  This is intended.  Also it does not
include newline characters, these are not needed either.

Here we see the Tsi148 domain's error message formatting function.
Since a pointer to this very function was passed to the error handling
module during domain initialization for "Tsi148" and the error ID
of the error being logged begins with "0x03", the error handling
module knows to call this function to assist it in formatting a
displayable message.  In the error logging example above, we logged
a Tsi148 bus error (error ID = 0x03010201).  Now our registration
disposition for this particular error included 
ERROR_DISP_IMMEDIATE_DISPLAY.  Here is how the error handling module
might display this error.

.CS
	ErrLog:  JUL 21 15:36:38 "Tsi148  " (03010201):
                Bus error: status = 0x00002000, addr = 0xc000ffff
.CE

Notice the components of the error message:

ErrLog: Preface is always part of the message to identify this as
an "error log" message.

"JUL 21 15:36:38" - is obtained from the "time tag" which the
error handling module attached to the error message when it was 
logged.

"Tsi148  " - Is the ASCII domain string which was saved by the
error handling module during domain initialization of error type
0x03000000.

"(03010201)" - Is the error ID which was passed to the error handling
module by the application when the error was logged.

"Bus error: status = 0x00002000, addr = 0xc000fffff" is constructed
from two components:  When the error was logged, two parameters
(out of a possible maximum of six) were presented to the error handling
module in the logging message parameter elements, errorMsg.params[0], 
and errorMsg.params[1].  The errorTask checks the domain initialization
for this error and sees that an error formatting function had
been specified.  It calls this function with the error ID to obtain
the formatting string which it uses, along with the parameters passed
in errorMsg.params[0-1] to construct the string to display.

Notice that if a formatting function had not been specified, then
the error task would have only displayed the first line:

.CS
	ErrLog:  JUL 21 15:36:38 "Tsi148  " (03010201):
.CE

If certain errors in the domain do not require a formatted message
component to be displayed, the formatting function should simply
return NULL for those particular error IDs.

SHOW ROUTINES

When INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES is #define'd the following functions
are available:

.CS
sysErrorDomainShow (void)
sysErrorRegisterShow (mask, compare)
sysErrorLogShow (mask, compare)
.CE

Examples of use are:

.CS

-> sysErrorDomainShow ()

Error Domain Initializations: sysErrorDomainShow ()

No.     Domain        Error ID      FmtFcn     ScanFcn    ClearFcn
------------------------------------------------------------------

 2      CPU           01xxxxxx           0           0           0
 3      Tsi148        03xxxxxx      114c40      114c90      114cbc
 4      PCI           04xxxxxx           0           0           0
 5      Widget        0fxxxxxx      114a2c      114a4c      114a8c

.CE

The above example shows five different domains have initialized.
Two of these domains ("Tsi148" and "Widget") have registered formatting
scanning and clearing functions.  The other domains ("Disco II",
"CPU", and "PCI") have initialized but they have specified NULL
pointers for their formatting, scanning and clearing functions.

.CS

-> sysErrorRegisterShow (0,0)

Error Registrations: sysErrorRegisterShow (0x00000000, 0x00000000)

No.  Error ID              Disposition   Fcn       Param
--------------------------------------------------------
  1  03010201("Tsi148")    dsp.sav.      0         0
       Msg: "Bus error: status = 0x%08x, addr = 0x%08x"
  2  0f010101("Widget")    dsp.sav.      0         0
  3  0f010201("Widget")    fcn.dsp.sav.  114acc    16
       Msg: "Widget count error, received = %d, actual = %d"
  4  01010001("CPU")       sav.          0         0
  5  04010101("PCI")       ignore        0         0

.CE

This shows that five errors have been registered.  The error IDs
associated with each error are displyed along with the domain name
string.  Also a disposition field is presented indicating combinations
"user function call" (fcn), "immediate display" (dsp), and/or "save in
log file" (sav) or simply "ignore".  In the above table, we see that
error code 0x03010201 and 0x0f010201 are both associated with a
formatting string (a format helper function was provided at domain
initialization and it indeed returns a non-NULL formatting string).
Also error code 0x0f010201 is associated with a logging function at
0x114acc which will be called with parameter 16 when this particular
error is logged.

sysErrorRegisterShow() takes two arguments: 'mask' and 'compare'.
Several of the functions in the error handling suite take these two
arguments.  They are used to filter error IDs which appear in a table.
Only error IDs which pass the filter are acted on by the function.

The filtering operation is:

.CS
  if ((tableID & mask) == compare)
      {

      /@ tableID passes through filter @/

      }
  else
      {

      /@ tableID is blocked by filter @/

      }
.CE

So in the above example if we had used 'mask' of 0xff000000 and
'compare' of 0x03000000 by entering:

.CS
-> sysErrorRegisterShow (0xff000000, 0x03000000)
.CE

Only the "Tsi148" error IDs would would have been displayed since
0x03xxxxxx is the only type of ID which will pass this filter.
Using (0,0) as the mask and compare allows causes everything to
match.  Since (0,0) is the default VxWorks argument passage when
no arguments are entered, simply entering:

.CS

-> sysErrorRegisterShow

.CE

Would cause the entire table to be displayed.

.CS

-> sysErrorLogRawShow (0, 0)

Errors currently logged: sysErrorLogRawDisplay (0x0, 0x0)

No.  time     ID       p0       p1       p2       p3       p4       p5

.CE

This command displays in "raw" format the errors which have been saved
in the log file.  Note that this command also uses 'mask' and 'compare'
filtering.  The display show the time tag, error ID, and the six parameters
which were part of the ERROR_MSG when the error was logged.  

This same display can also be presented in a more readable format via:

.CS

-> sysErrorLogShow (0, 0)

Errors currently logged: sysErrorLogDisplay (0x0, 0x0)

0001:  JUL 23 10:17:55 "CPU     " (01010001):
0002:  JUL 23 10:17:57 "Widget  " (0f010201):
       Widget count error, received = 32, actual = 34
0003:  JUL 23 10:17:59 "Tsi148  " (03100015):

0007:  JUL 23 10:18:02 "Tsi148  " (03100019):

.CE

Notice that sysErrorLogRawShow and sysErrorLogShow are aliases
to the functions sysErrorLogRawDisplay and sysErrorLogDisplay.
The 'Display' functions which display the actual error log are 
considered essential any time INCLUDE_ERROR_HANDLING is #define'd.
Thus they are included even if INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES is not #define'd.
Also notice in the formatted display above that error code 0x0f010201
has an associated formatted string which is displayed as port of the
table.  

.CS
-> sysErrorHandlerShow
.CE

performs the following:

.CS
-> sysErrorDomainShow()
-> sysErrorRegisterShow (0, 0)

ERROR SCANNING and CLEARING FUNCTION

The error scanning function which is optionally presented to the
error handling module at domain initialization time should scan for
assertion of an error associated with the parameter error ID.  It's
up to the user as to what to do if the error is asserted.  Since 
this is a boolean function, it could return TRUE or FALSE depending
on whether or not the error is asserted.  Another likely thing that
it might do is to actually make an error logging call if it finds
that the error is asserted.

The error clearing function is also a boolean function.  It is 
up to the user what this function does but returning TRUE if
the error was actually cleared might be useful.

LOG TABLE MANAGEMENT ROUTINES

There are several error log table management routines which
are presented below:

sysErrorScan (mask, compare) will go through the error registration
table and for each registered ID which passes the 'mask'/'compare'
filter it will call the associated scanning routine if such a routine
exists.

sysErrorClear (mask, compare) is similar to sysErrorScan() except
it will call the error clearing routine if it exists.

sysErrorDispositionIgnore (mask, compare) will change the disposition
to 'ignore' for any registered error IDs which pass the filter.

sysErrorDispositionSave (mask, compare) will add 'save' to the
disposition of any error IDs which pass the filter.

sysErrorDispositionDisplay (mask, compare) will add the 'immediate
display' disposition to any error IDs which pass the filter.

sysErrorDispositionFunction (mask, compare) will add the 'function
call' disposition to any error IDs which pass the filter.  Note that
the already registered error should have a function registered for
calling prior to use of this command.  If the function pointer is
NULL this command has no real functional effect.

sysErrorLogRemove (mask, compare) will remove from the log file,
any logged errors whose ID passes the filter.  This will free up
some room in the table for new errors.
