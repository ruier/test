 * PCI Processor (LOCAL) and Bus (BUS) Definitions
 *
 * The following definitions determine the address ranges for PCI Memory

 * Bridge as well as perform PCI Auto-Configuration.  There are two sets
 * of definitions, one for each of the MV64360's busses (0.0 and 1.0). 
 *
 * PCI Memory Space:
 * This is a one-to-one mapping.  The address used on the processor bus is the
 * address used on the PCI memory bus.
 *
 * PCIx_MSTR_MEMIO_LOCAL =  PCI Non-Prefetchable Memory Space 
 *                          (processor bus view), 'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate
 *                          which of the MV64360 busses are being mapped
 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).
 * PCIx_MSTR_MEMIO_BUS =    PCI Non-Prefetchable Memory Space 
 *                          (PCI memory bus view), 'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate 
 *                          which of the MV64360 busses are being mapped 
 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).

 * PCIx_MSTR_MEM_LOCAL  =   PCI Prefetchable Memory Space
 *                          (processor bus view), 'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate

 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).
 *
 * PCI I/O Space:
 * This is not a one-to-one mapping.  For Bus 1.0 the I/O space will start
 * at 0x00000000 on the PCI I/O bus.  For Bus 0.0 the I/O space (32-bit only)
 * will not start at 0x00000000, but at the top of Bus 1.0's I/O space.  This 
 * is to prevent overlap between bus addresses. 
 *
 * NOTE: Bus 0.0 does not contain 16-bit PCI I/O space.
 *
 * ISA_MSTR_IO_LOCAL =   PCI 16-bit I/O Space (processor bus view) - this
 *                       space only exists on bus 1.0.
 *
 * ISA_MSTR_IO_BUS =     PCI 16-bit I/O Space (PCI I/O bus view) - this
 *                       space only exists on bus 1.0.
 *
 * PCIx_MSTR_IO_LOCAL =  PCI 32-bit I/O Space (processor bus view)
 *                       'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate which of the MV64360 
 *                       busses are being mapped (0.0 or 1.0).

 *                       busses are being mapped (0.0 or 1.0).
 * 
 * Note that PCI window base addresses and sizes must conform to the
 * following two constraints:
 *
 * 1.  The window size must be a power of 2.
 *
 * 2.  The window base address must be an integral multiple of the
 *     size.
 * 
 * The constraints are enforced at compile time with error generation
 * if a violation occurs.
