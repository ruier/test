--------------------
01e,15may08,x_f  Remove i2cInitFlag and cpuBusSpd variable.
01d,03mar03,cak  Set I2C baud rate to "worst case" default instead
                 of trying to caculate optimal value based on bus speed.
01c,28jan03,cak  Replaced all references to a DFLT_BUS_CLK and 
                 DEC_CLOCK_FREQ with a new definition that can be
                 either hard-coded or dynamically calculated. 
01b,29aug02,cak  Incorporated fixes from ver 01a, hxeb100/sysMv64260I2c.c.
01a,22may02,cak  Created.

DESCRIPTION
This file contains the low-level routines which generate the following 
cycles on the I2C bus, via the MV64360's I2C interface:

\cs
  Start
  Stop
  Acknowledge-in
  Acknowledge-out
  Read
  Write
\ce

An initialization routine is also provided to initialize the I2C interface.

     * We will set the baud rate to the "worst case" value.  This
     * value will work under all circumstances for any bus speed.
     * Using this value has the following effect:
     *
     * 1.  The code is simplified.
     *     The optimal baud rate calculation requires the use of a
     *     precalculated "normalized" bus speed.  By using a
     *     "worst case" value which works for all bus speeds, we
     *     eliminate the need for a "bus speed normalization"
     *     function.
     *
     * 2.  The rate at which of the VPD can be read will be slightly
     *     slower than if an optimal baud rate value (calculated from
     *     "normalized" bus speed) were used.  The performance
     *     degradation "worst case" would result if we were running
     *     with a 100MHz bus and would be 0x23/0x2c = 0.8 as fast as
     *     if the optimal baud rate were used.  For busses faster
     *     than 100MHz, the degradation is not as severe.  I2C accesses
     *     are only done at initialization and during some user commands
     *     such as "vpdShow".  Thus, this minor degradation in speed
     *     is not considered to be an important issue.
