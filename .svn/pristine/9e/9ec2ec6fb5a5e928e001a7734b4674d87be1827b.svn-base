DESCRIPTION

This file provides device independent top-level DMA routines for general
use. By using these routines, applications will not be affected by
DMA controller differences in future BSPs.

The DMA functions provided support initialization, configuration, 
start, pause, resume, abort and status retrieval of DMA operations on a 
per channel basis. Other device specific functions may be available in
the <device>Dma.c file, but may not always be available in the future.

The DMA initialization routine must be called once before any other DMA
routine is invoked. Failure to do so will result in status error returns
from all other DMA functions. This initialization is handled by sysHwInit2 
whenever INCLUDE_<device>_DMA is defined in config.h. 

To start DMA for a particular channel, invoke the start routine with
the desired addresses, byte count and transfer attributes. These 
parameters are specified via separate descriptor and attribute 
structures defined in sysDma.h. 

DMA is supported from DRAM to DRAM, DRAM to PCI, PCI to DRAM, and PCI to 
PCI by appropriate selection of the source and destination addresses 
supplied in the DMA descriptor. The starting address for either or both
source and destination may be optionally held (no increment) during the 
transfer.

The user interrupt handler, if provided, must conform to the rules for 
standard VxWorks interrupt service routines. It is called with a current
channel parameter during handling of both normal completion and error 
interrupts. Since this routine is called by the driver interrupt handlers,
the user routine is not responsible for clearing interrupts. Interrupts 
are cleared after the user routine returns to the driver's handler.

All parameter validation is performed in the actual driver functions.

* Register defaults are also initialized.
*

/******************************************************************************
*
* sysDmaStart - Configure and start the DMA controller.
*
* This function sets up the DMA controller for a block mode or chain mode
* DMA transfer. The user must fill out the DMA descriptor and DMA attribute
* parameters according to device specifications.
*
* Transfer options are set according to dmaAttrib. The descriptor registers
* are programmed according dmaDesc. Interrupts for the given channel are
* enabled and the transfer is initiated.
*
* Both block mode and chain mode are supported.  To invoke chain mode,
* nextDescPtr of dmaDesc must have a nonzero value.  Otherwise, if nextDescPtr
* of dmaDesc is zero, the function sets up the DMA transfer in block mode.
*
* The user has three options for being notified of the completion of a DMA
* transaction depending on the contents of the userHandler field in the
* dmaAttrib parameter. The first is to have the DMA start routine wait for
* the done interrupt. The start routine then returns with DMA status
* (dmaDesc.userHandler == WAIT_FOREVER).  The second option is to provide a 
* user routine for the DMA interrupt handler to call upon completion 
* (dmaDesc.userHandler == user routine). The routine must follow the rules 
* for executing inside an ISR by not calling waits, prints, etc. The 
* sysDmaStart routine returns immediately so the user task can proceed with its
* execution. The third option is for no user interrupt handler, but still
* allows sysDmaStart to return immediately (dmaDesc.userHandler == 0). In
* the later two cases sysDmaStatus can be called later to get the DMA results.
*
* Status is returned by sysDmaStart when the dmaStatus parameter is not
* NULL and when using dmaDesc.userHandler == WAIT_FOREVER or by calling
* sysDmaStatus directly.  In any case, the status should be interpreted 
* using the appropriate device status structure defined in <device>Dma.h.
*
* RETURNS: 
* OK is returned if the channel started successfully.
* ERROR is returned if the driver is not initialized, or the 
* channel is invalid or busy, or a parameter is invalid.
*
* ERRNO
