 * PCI Processor (LOCAL) and Bus (BUS) Definitions
 *
 * The following definitions determine the address ranges for PCI Memory

 * Bridge as well as perform PCI Auto-Configuration.  There are two sets
 * of definitions, one for each of the MV64260's busses (0.0 and 1.0).
 *
 * PCI Memory Space:
 * This is a one-to-one mapping.  The address used on the processor bus is the
 * address used on the PCI memory bus.
 *
 * PCIx_MSTR_MEMIO_LOCAL =  PCI Non-Prefetchable Memory Space
 *                          (processor bus view), 'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate
 *                          which of the MV64260 busses are being mapped
 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).
 * PCIx_MSTR_MEMIO_BUS =    PCI Non-Prefetchable Memory Space
 *                          (PCI memory bus view), 'x' = 0 or 1 to indicate
 *                          which of the MV64260 busses are being mapped
 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).

 *                          (0.0 or 1.0).
 *
 * PCI I/O Space:
 * This is not a one-to-one mapping.  For Bus 0.0 the I/O space will start
 * at 0x00000000 on the PCI I/O bus.  For Bus 1.0 the I/O space (32-bit only)
 * will not start at 0x00000000, but at the top of Bus 1.0's I/O space.  This
 * is to prevent overlap between bus addresses.
 *
 * NOTE: Bus 1.0 does not contain 16-bit PCI I/O space.
 *
 * ISA_MSTR_IO_LOCAL =   PCI 16-bit I/O Space (processor bus view) - this
 *                       space only exists on bus 0.0.
 *
 * ISA_MSTR_IO_BUS =     PCI 16-bit I/O Space (PCI I/O bus view) - this
 *                       space only exists on bus 0.0.
 *
 * PCIx_MSTR_IO_LOCAL =  PCI 32-bit I/O Space (processor bus view)

 *                       busses are being mapped (0.0 or 1.0).
 *
 * Note that PCI window base addresses and sizes must conform to the
 * following two constraints:
 *
 * 1.  The window size must be a power of 2.
 *
 * 2.  The window size must be greater than or equal to 1MB in order
 *     to satisfy host bridge address decoders.
 *
 * 3.  The window base address must be an integral multiple of the
 *     size.
 *
 * The constraints are enforced at compile time with error generation

 * Serial Port Support
 *
 * The MVME5500 uses the PC16550 Universal Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
 * on the MV64260 device controller bus to support two async serial
 * ports (COM0, COM1).  Interrupts for COM0/COM1 share GPP pin 0.
 * In order to enable the COM port interrupts on the MVME5500 we must
 * unmask the GPP interrupt in the GPP interrupt mask register.  We must also
 * enable this GPP interrupt in the Main Interrupt High Cause register,
 * by calling intEnable with GPP_INT_LVL_0_7 as the argument in sysHwInit2().
 *
 * Installing an IPMC761/712 transition module (and MVME761/712 transition 
 * board) adds an additional 4 serial ports.  Two 16550-compatible async 
 * serial ports and two async/sync serial ports.
