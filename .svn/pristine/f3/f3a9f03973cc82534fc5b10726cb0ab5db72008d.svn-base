 * L2 & L3 Cache Support
 *
 * The following features of the L2 cache can be configured (these are
 * relevant only if INCLUDE_CACHE_L2 is defined):
 *
 * (1) Number of prefetch engines enabled
 * The number of prefetch engines enabled can range from none (disabled)
 * to 3.  This is controlled with the MSSCR0_L2_PREFETCH_ENGINES definition.
 * The default number of prefetch engines is 1 (MSSCR0_L2PFE_ONE). Valid
 * settings include: MSSCR0_L2PFE_NONE, MSSCR0_L2PFE_TWO, and
 * MSSCR0_L2PFE_THREE.
 *
 * (2) Enable/Disable L2 Data Parity Checking
 * L2 data parity checking can be enabled/disabled with the
 * ENABLE_L2_DATA_PARITY definition.  Parity checking is enabled by
 * default.
 *
 * (3) Mode
 * The L2 cache can be configured for Instruction-only mode, Data-only
 * mode, or both (instructions and data) with the L2_MODE definition.
 * The default is to allow cacheing of data and instructions 
 * (L2_MODE_INST_AND_DATA).
 * Valid settings also include: L2_MODE_I_ONLY and L2_MODE_D_ONLY.
 *
 * (4) L2 Replacement Algorithm
 * The L2 cache replacement algorithm can be configured for Default replacement
 * algorithm or Secondary replacement algorithm.  The default is
 * to use the secondary replacement algorithm (L2_REP_ALG_SECONDARY).  To use
 * the default algorithm set L2_REP_ALG to L2_REP_ALG_DEFAULT.
 *
 * The following features of the L3 Cache can be configured (these are
 * relevant only if INCLUDE_CACHE_L3 is defined):
 *
 * (1) Mode
 * The L3 cache can be configured for Instruction-only mode, Data-only
 * mode, or both (instructions and data) with the L3_MODE definition.
 * The default is to allow cacheing of data and instructions 
 * (L3_MODE_INST_AND_DATA).
 * Valid settings also include: L3_MODE_I_ONLY and L3_MODE_D_ONLY.
 * See "Errata Workaround" below for more information.
 *
 * (2) L3 Replacement Algorithm
 * The L3 cache replacement algorithm can be configured for Default replacement
 * algorithm or Secondary replacement algorithm.  The default is
 * to use the secondary replacement algorithm (L3_REP_ALG_SECONDARY).  To use
 * the default algorithm set L3_REP_ALG to L3_REP_ALG_DEFAULT.
 *
 * Errata Workaround (MPC7455/7457 Revisions 0100 & 0101):
 *
 * Errata #15 "Six outstanding miss requests may stall the processor"
 * in MPC7457CE Rev.5, 12/2003 specifies that a processor configured
 * with 2MB of L3 cache must adhere to either of the following two
 * software workarounds:
 *  (1) Operate in 1MB cache, 1MB private memory mode, in which case
 *	the mode of the cache can be instruction-only, data-only, or
 *	both instruction and data, or
 *  (2) Operate the L3 cache (2MB) in instruction-mode only.
 *
 * To implement these workarounds the definition 
 * ERRATA_WORKAROUND_2MB_IONLY has been created.  If you wish to operate
 * in cache-only mode (ie. no private memory) this definition will
 * determine which of the above two workarounds is chosen.  For example,
 * if ERRATA_WORKAROUND_2MB_IONLY is defined then the full 2MB of
 * cache will be configured to operate in instruction-only mode.  However,
 * if it is not defined (#undef'd), then only 1MB of the cache will be
 * utilized and the mode will be determined by L3_MODE.  If you decide
 * to enable the private memory support then ERRATA_WORKAROUND_2MB_IONLY
 * will be used to determine the initial configuration of the L3 cache,
 * which is necessary to perform prior to configuring and enabling the
 * private memory by calling the sysL3CachePmEnable() routine in
 * sysL3Cache.c.  Ultimately the mode of the non-private memory portion
 * of cache will be set according to L3_MODE as well.
 *
 * BSP Default L3 Cache Configuration:
 *
 * By default, the L3 cache is enabled, private memory is disabled,
 * "data and instructions" mode is specified, and option (2) of the 
 * errata workarounds is chosen by undefining ERRATA_WORKAROUND_2MB_IONLY.  
 * This means that, for revisions "0100" and "0101" of the MPC7455/7457
 * processors, only 1MB of the L3 cache is utilized and it is 
 * configured for data and instructions.

/*
 * Firmware RAM & ROM Booting
 *
 * #define'ing FIRMWARE_BOOT allows one to use the MOTLoad firmware
 * command 'execProgram' to begin execution of VxWorks code rather
 * than having the processor, upon powerup, automatically begin
 * executing code from the cold boot location.  This provides
 * flexibility in just where the VxWorks image can reside and
 * still be invoked for execution.
 *
 * The code which is executed via MOTLoad's execProgram command
 * must have been previously loaded into RAM or alternatively
 * placed into flash memory.  The commentary which follows explains
 * this process.
 *
 * To execute a RAM-resident VxWorks "boot" image (rather than
 * a flash resident "boot" image), perform the following:
 *
 * 1. Change #undef FIRMWARE_BOOT to #define FIRMWARE_BOOT.
 * 2. In mv6100A.h, ROM_BASE_ADRS may need to be adjusted.  It is
 *    currently set, for RAM booting, based on the assumption that
 *    there is 512MB of DRAM.  However, this should be adjusted
 *    to the actual amount of DRAM on the board minus 1MB, in order to
 *    leave room for the vxWorks boot image at the top of DRAM.
 *      DRAM - 0x100000  (currently set to 0x1ff00000, if FIRMWARE_BOOT
 *                        is #define'd)
 * 3. Since ROM_TEXT_ADRS and ROM_WARM_ADRS are defined in both the
 *    Makefile(hard-coded) and config.h(based on the value of ROM_BASE_ADRS)
 *    it is necessary to adjust the values of ROM_TEXT_ADRS and
 *    ROM_WARM_ADRS in the Makefile.  The values used are dependent upon
 *    the value of ROM_BASE_ADRS as discussed in #2 above.  For a board
 *    with 512MB of DRAM they would be 0x1ff00000 and 0x1ff00004, respectively.
 * 
 * NOTE: If FIRMWARE_BOOT is defined then USER_RESERVED_MEM will be
 *       defined as 0x100000 (1MB) in order to preserve the boot image
 *       in the top 1 MB of the DRAM.
 *
 * To use the firmware to boot vxWorks from DRAM use the following commands
 * (substitute the appropriate values where necessary).  The values used
 * for the tftp download address and the execP load address are based on a
 * board with 512MB of DRAM:
 *
 * tftpGet -cXXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -fboot.bin -sXXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -d/dev/enetx -a1FF00000
 * execProgram -l1FF00000 -s100000
 *
 * A "cold boot" (powerup boot) always causes the image flashed into
 * the last megabyte of the boot flash to be executed.  The execution
 * address for cold boot start is the PPC reset vector at 0xfff00100
 * which is in the last megabyte of the 4-gigabyte address space.  We
 * may want to use a flash bank to hold an image for execution but we
 * also want to protect the "cold boot" image that is present in the last
 * megabyte of flash memory in this bank.  We can use the first
 * megabyte of flash memory for our executable image and use the
 * MOTLoad "execProgram" command to execute that image - thus
 * protecting the "cold boot" image which is located in the last
 * megabyte of flash memory.  The explanation which follows describes
 * how to do this.
 *
 * Remember that no matter how the flash bank selection jumper is set, the
 * base address (address of first megabyte) of the boot flash bank is
 * always 0xf8000000.  Likewise the address of the non-boot flash bank is
 * always 0xf4000000 (see the memory map diagram contained in this file).
 *
 * To execute a vxWorks "boot" image from ROM, perform the following:
 * 
 * 1. Change #undef FIRMWARE_BOOT to #define FIRMWARE_BOOT.
 *
 * 2. In mv6100A.h, ROM_BASE_ADRS will need to be set to the start address
 *    of the flash bank from which the code will be executed via the MOTLoad
 *    "execProgram" command.  Since we are specifying the start address
 *    (first megabyte) of the flash bank, the image that is resident in
 *    the last megabyte (cold boot image) will be protected.  So, if your
 *    image to execute is located in the first megabyte of the boot flash
 *    bank you would set ROM_BASE_ADRS to be 0xf8000000.  If the image is
 *    located in the first megabyte of the non-boot flash bank you would
 *    set ROM_BASE_ADRS to be 0xf4000000.
 * 3. Since ROM_TEXT_ADRS and ROM_WARM_ADRS are defined in both the
 *    Makefile(hard-coded) and config.h(based on the value of ROM_BASE_ADRS)
 *    it is necessary to adjust the values of ROM_TEXT_ADRS and
 *    ROM_WARM_ADRS in the Makefile.  The values used are dependent upon
 *    the value of ROM_BASE_ADRS as discussed in #2 above.  When booting from
 *    the non-boot flash bank they would be 0xf4000000 and 0xf4000004,
 *    respectively.  When booting from the boot flash bank they would be
 *    0xf8000000 and 0xf8000004, respectively.
 * 4. If FIRMWARE_BOOT is defined, USER_RESERVED_MEM will be set to
 *    0x100000 (1MB).  The reason for this is to setup the firmware booting
 *    for DRAM booting by default, rather than ROM booting.  If left as
 *    is the top 1MB of DRAM will be reserved, which is not necessary when
 *    booting from ROM.  To change this simply change USER_RESERVED_MEM,
 *    located near the end of this file, to 0x0.
 *
 * To use the firmware to boot vxWorks from ROM use the following commands
 * (substitute the appropriate values where necessary).  The execP load address
 *  is dependent upon which flash bank the VxWorks image is located in):
 *
 * tftpGet -cXXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -fboot.bin -sXXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -d/dev/enetx
 * flashProgram -o0 -nfff00 -d/dev/flashx
 * execProgram -lF4000000 -s100000

/*
 * PCI and PCI Auto-Configuration Support
 *
 * PCIx_MSTR_IO_SIZE, PCIx_MSTR_MEMIO_SIZE and PCIx_MSTR_MEM_SIZE
 * control the sizes of the available   PCI address spaces.  ('x' is
 * '0' for bus 0.0 and '1' for bus 1.0) The windows defined by these
 * parameters must be large enough to accommodate all of the PCI
 * memory and I/O space requests found during PCI autoconfiguration.
 * If they are not, some devices will not be autoconfigured.
 *
 * Be aware that these values alter entries in the sysPhysMemDesc[]
 * array (in sysLib.c) and affect the size of the resulting MMU tables
 * at the rate of 128:1.  For each 128K of address space, a 1K piece
 * of RAM will be used for MMU tables.  If the region is very large,
 * modifications to sysLib.c can be made to use BAT (Block Address
 * Translation) registers instead of MMU page tables to map the
 * memory.
 *
 * NOTE: Since PCI auto-configuration is performed by the bootroms,
 * changing any of these values requires the creation of new bootroms.

 *
 * Here's a recap:
 *
 * If this is not the anchor node (SM_OFF_BOARD == TRUE)
 * then
 *     No A32 inbound mappings are programmed for access to DRAM.
 *     Note that all nodes must have inbound mapping to reach 
 *     their mailbox's so shared memory doorbells can
 *     be hit by any other node.  This is taken care of by the
 *     RAI register programming on Universe equipped boards and
 *     the CRG programming by Tempe equipped boards.
 * else
 *     (this is the anchor node ...)
 *     A single inbound mapping through Tempe window 0 is configured,
 *     mapping DRAM address 0x00000000 through 0x0003ffff to VME
 *     bus address 0x08000000 through 0x0803ffff.
 *
 * PCI Mapped Memory consists of non-prefetchable and prefetchable.
 * Each bus has its own non-prefetchable and prefetchable memory
 * spaces.
 *
 * The maximum amount of non-prefetchable PCI memory is defined by
 * the user as PCI0_MSTR_MEMIO_SIZE and PCI1_MSTR_MEMIO_SIZE.
 *
 * The maximum amount of prefetchable PCI memory is defined by the
 * user as PCI0_MSTR_MEM_SIZE and PCI1_MSTR_MEM_SIZE.
 *
 * PCI Mapped I/O consists of 16 and 32 bit I/O. Only bus 1.0 contains
 * 16 bit I/O space.
 *
 * The amount of 16 bit I/O, for bus 1.0, is configured by
 * ISA_MSTR_IO_SIZE and defaults to 64KB in size. This area begins at
 * 0x0 on the PCI I/O bus (1.0), and ISA_MSTR_IO_LOCAL on 
 * the processor bus.
 *
 * The amount of 32 bit I/O is configured by PCI0_MSTR_IO_SIZE and
 * PCI1_MSTR_IO_SIZE.
 *
 * PCI_MEM_LOCAL_START:
 *
 * Local (CPU referenced) base address of all PCI space.  This must satisfy
 * the following conditions:
 *
 * 1) It must have a value greater than the highest DRAM address.
 * 2) It must be a multiple of 0x00100000 to satisfy host bridge address
 *       decoders.
 *
 * The space beginning with this address and ending with the base address
 * of the host bridge registers (MV64360_REG_BASE = 0xf1000000) is used
 * for local access to PCI space.
