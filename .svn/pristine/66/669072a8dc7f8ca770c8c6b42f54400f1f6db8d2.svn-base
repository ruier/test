/*
This stub file provides the user with the means to create a TrueFFS compliant 
socket component driver for use with any BSP. This is sample code and it is
expected, even required, to be modified after it is added to a BSP by the 
project facility when the component INCLUDE_TFFS is added to a kernel project.
Look for #error and TODO statements in the sample code.

This stub does not provides code, just some procedural macros that the
generic driver code will use.

DESCRIPTION
This library must provide board-specific hardware access routines for TrueFFS.
In effect, these routines comprise the socket component driver (or drivers)
for your flash device.  At socket registration time, TrueFFS stores
the functions provided by this socket component driver in an 'FLSocket'
structure.  When TrueFFS needs to access the flash device, it uses these
functions. 
 
Because this file is, for the most part, a device driver that exports its
functionality by registering function pointers with TrueFFS, very few of the
functions defined here are externally callable.  For the record, the only
external functions are flFitInSocketWindow() and flDelayLoop(), and you should
never have to call them.
 
However, one of the most important functions defined in this file is neither
referenced in an 'FLSocket' structure, nor is it externally callable.  This
function is sysTffsInit() and it should only be called by TrueFFS.  TrueFFS 
calls this function at initialization time to register socket component 
drivers for all the flash devices attached to your target.  It is this call 
to sysTffs() that results in assigning drive numbers to the flash devices on 
your target hardware.  Drive numbers are assigned by the order in which the 
socket component drivers are registered. The first to be registered is drive 
0, the second is drive 1, and so on up to 4.  As shipped, TrueFFS supports up 
to five flash drives.
 
After registering socket component drivers for a flash device, you may
format the flash medium even though there is not yet a block device driver
associated with the flash (see the reference entry for the tffsDevCreate()
routine).  To format the flash medium for use with TrueFFS,
call tffsDevFormat() or, for some BSPs, sysTffsFormat().
 
The sysTffsFormat() routine is an optional,BSP-specific helper routine that
can be called externally. Internally, sysTffsFormat() calls tffsDevFormat() 
with a pointer to a 'FormatParams' structure that is initialized to values 
that leave a space on the flash device for a boot image. This space is outside 
the region managed by TrueFFS.  This special region is necessary for boot
images because the normal translation and wear-leveling services of TrueFFS
are incompatible with the needs of the boot program and the boot image it
relies upon.  To write a boot image (or any other data) into this area,
use tffsBootImagePut(). 
 
The function sysTffsFormat() is only provided when a Flash SIMM has to have 
the TrueFFS file system in some desired fraction of it. It is provided only 
for the purpose of simplifying the process of formatting a Flash part 
that should be subdivided.

The Flash SIMM might also be referred to as RFA (Resident Flash Array) in the 
following text.

Example implentations of sysTffs.c can be found in the directory

    $(WIND_BASE)/target/src/drv/tffs/sockets

The files sds860-sysTffs.c and pc386-sysTffs.c have support for single and dual 
socketed PCMCIA devices as well if that might be useful to you. They both 
support multiple sockets.


Finally, this file also contains define statements for symbolic constants
that determine which MTDs, translation layer modules, and other utilities
are ultimately included in TrueFFS.  These defines are as follows:

\is
\i INCLUDE_TL_FTL
To include the NOR-based translation layer module.
\i INCLUDE_TL_SSFDC
To include the SSFDC-appropriate translation layer module.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_I28F016
For Intel 28f016 flash devices.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_I28F008
For Intel 28f008 flash devices.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_I28F008_BAJA
For Intel 28f008 flash devices on the Heurikon Baja 4700.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_AMD
For AMD, Fujitsu: 29F0{40,80,16} 8-bit flash devices.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_CFISCS
For CFI/SCS flash devices.
\i INCLUDE_MTD_WAMD
For AMD, Fujitsu 29F0{40,80,16} 16-bit flash devices.
\i INCLUDE_TFFS_BOOT_IMAGE
To include tffsBootImagePut() in TrueFFS for Tornado.
\ie
To exclude any of the modules mentioned above, edit sysTffs.c and undefine
its associated symbolic constant.
