# BOOT_EXTRA and MACH_EXTRA
# 
# romInit.s should not call out to subroutines declared in other modules.
# If an outside module is necessary, it can be linked into the system by
# adding the module to BOOT_EXTRA.  If the same module is referenced by
# other BSP code, then the module must be added to MACH_EXTRA as well.
# This is done to prevent the module from being compressed, since it is
# needed before the uncompression has taken place.
#
# The BSP Developer's Kit defines BOOT_EXTRA as "Additional modules to be
# linked with compressed ROM images.  These modules are not linked with
# uncompressed or ROM-resident images, just compressed images.  Adding a
# module to MACH_EXTRA makes it available to uncompressed or ROM-resident
# images.  MACH_EXTRA is used to "add an object module to VxWorks...This 
# macro causes the linker to link it into the output object."  It is used
# to include object modules that are not "included" via sysLib.c. 
#
# NOTE: If INCLUDE_GEISC_END, in config.h, is undefined then mv64360End.obj
#       on the MACH_EXTRA line must either be removed or commented out.
#       This is to prevent compiler errors.
